            <strong> </strong> This module provides a comprehensive and professional solution for managing construction
            invoices for both clients and contractors. It enables users to efficiently organize and calculate invoices
            based on the percentage of completion for each item in the invoice. Furthermore, it tracks the quantities
            previously invoiced in past invoices, providing a complete and up-to-date view of the project's financial
            status.

            Key Features:

            Professional Invoice Management: Create and manage construction invoices for both clients and contractors
            based on the percentage of completion for each item. This ensures accurate and transparent invoicing aligned
            with the actual work progress.

            Track Previously Invoiced Quantities: Maintain a detailed record of quantities previously invoiced in
            earlier invoices to prevent duplication and ensure consistency in billing across all project phases.

            Comprehensive Project Invoice Overview: View all invoices related to a project, whether they belong to
            clients or contractors. This feature provides a holistic view of the project's financial health and
            progress.

            Customizable Invoice Reports: Generate and print detailed invoice reports that showcase the completion
            percentage for each item, the executed quantities, and the quantities already invoiced. This facilitates
            clear communication and documentation with all stakeholders.

            This module streamlines the management of construction invoices, enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and
            transparency throughout the project lifecycle, benefiting all involved parties.
