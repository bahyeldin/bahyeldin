        <h2>Construction Invoicing Management</h2>
        <p>
            <strong> </strong> With this module, you can effortlessly create construction invoices for your clients. You
            can easily specify the quantity and completion percentage from the previous invoice, as well as the quantity
            and completion percentage for the current invoice. This keeps you always informed about the project's status
            up to the present moment. The module automatically calculates the value of the current invoice and also
            allows you to quickly generate the next invoice for the project. Simply duplicate the current invoice and
            click the button to transfer all quantities and percentages from the previous invoice to the relevant fields
            in the new invoice, under "Previous Quantities" and "Previous Percentages."

            Additionally, you can easily print a detailed construction summary that includes the project's basic
            information and a table displaying the invoice items, with sections for previous quantities and percentages,
            current quantities and percentages, and the value of the current due invoice. also integrated with all odoo
            modules. for more details https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T37lYa8ihKE . don't hesitate to contact
